# Codewars Solutions
This is a public repository for all my Codewars solutions. The earlier files may just be the solution, but later files up to present day have comments with the URL I had for the problem and the instructions in addition to my answer.

## Optimizations
As I continue to get used to a certain level of difficulty, I will increase the difficulty by 1 level.

## Lessons Learned
- I'm getting used to chaining methods together and solving problems using less lines of code (it's not always the best way, but it's stretching my imagination for how a problem can be solved in as little code as possible)
- `num.toString(2)` is a great way to turn a base 10 number into binary. It returns a string but you can use Number() on it to turn it back into a Number data type.
- `Array.flat()` will flatten out multidementional arrays, which makes it easier to loop through every item.
